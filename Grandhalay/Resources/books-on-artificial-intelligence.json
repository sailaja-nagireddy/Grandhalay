        "description": "Melanie Mitchell separates science fact from science fiction in this sweeping examination of the current state of AI and how it is remaking our world No recent scientific enterprise has proved as alluring, terrifying, and filled with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial intelligence. The award-winning author Melanie Mitchell, a leading computer scientist, now reveals AI’s turbulent history and the recent spate of apparent successes, grand hopes, and emerging fears surrounding it. In Artificial Intelligence, Mitchell turns to the most urgent questions concerning AI today: How intelligent—really—are the best AI programs? How do they work? What can they actually do, and when do they fail? How humanlike do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us? Along the way, she introduces the dominant models of modern AI and machine learning, describing cutting-edge AI programs, their human inventors, and the historical lines of thought underpinning recent achievements. She meets with fellow experts such as Douglas Hofstadter, the cognitive scientist and Pulitzer Prize–winning author of the modern classic Gödel, Escher, Bach, who explains why he is “terrified” about the future of AI. She explores the profound disconnect between the hype and the actual achievements in AI, providing a clear sense of what the field has accomplished and how much further it has to go. Interweaving stories about the science of AI and the people behind it, Artificial Intelligence brims with clear-sighted, captivating, and accessible accounts of the most interesting and provocative modern work in the field, flavored with Mitchell’s humor and personal observations. This frank, lively book is an indispensable guide to understanding today’s AI, its quest for “human-level” intelligence, and its impact on the future for us all.",

She discusses issues related to the integrity of researchers, technologists, and manufacturers as they design, construct, use, and manage artificially intelligent systems; formalisms for reasoning about moral decisions as part of the behavior of artificial autonomous systems such as agents and robots; and design methodologies for social agents based on societal, moral, and legal values. Throughout the book the author discusses related work, conscious of both classical, philosophical treatments of ethical issues and the implications in modern, algorithmic systems, and she combines regular references and footnotes with suggestions for further reading. This short overview is suitable for undergraduate students, in both technical and non-technical courses, and for interested and concerned researchers, practitioners, and citizens.",

This book promises to provide the most number of case studies and worked out examples than any other of its genre. The text is written in a highly interactive manner which makes for an avid reading. More into the text, the contents are well placed that it takes off from the introduction to AI, which is followed by heuristics searching and game playing. The machine learning section begins with the basis of learning, and the various association rule learning algorithms. Various types of learning like, reinforced, supervised, unsupervised and statistical are also included with numerous case studies and application exercises. The well explained algorithms and pseudo codes for each topic make this book useful for students. KEY FEATURES • Includes Case studies for each machine learning algorithm • Incorporates day to day examples and pictorial representations for a deeper understanding of the subject • Helps students to create programs easily",

        "description": "The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) has been in practice for over years with the advent of technological progress. Over time, it has blended our lives through nearly every narration of learning, teaching, enjoyment, normal routine operations and what not. The aspect delivers a common understanding of the topics with reference to it making an impact on our lives, with a better framework of technology affecting our lives in particular. Let us look up to science for a change to be brought about in us. Let us create awareness of making technology available to people, in a broader sense. As that happens, people who are responsible need to be told about the use and misuse of the same. As we lead our lives, we come across the fact that AI, Robotics and Learning Machines seem to be the household topic of discussion. Earlier, AI was perceived to be reserved for only ‘Geniuses’ or ‘Researchers’ or the ‘computer’ community, but it very aptly integrates and impacts each and every aspect of our lives. Knowingly or unknowingly, it has become intellectually influential in shaping our thoughts, actions and the day-to-day chores.",

The purpose of this book is to provide insights on how todays computer engineers can implement AI in real world applications. Overall, the field of artificial intelligence is extremely broad. In essence, AI has found applications, in one way or another, in every aspect of computing and in most aspects of modern life. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a complete review of the field in the framework of a single book, unless if the review is broad rather than deep. In this book we have chosen to present selected current and emerging practical applications of AI, thus allowing for a more detailed presentation of topics. The book is organized in four parts; General Purpose Applications of AI; Intelligent Human-Computer Interaction; Intelligent Applications in Signal Processing and eHealth; and Real world AI applications in Computer Engineering.\"",
